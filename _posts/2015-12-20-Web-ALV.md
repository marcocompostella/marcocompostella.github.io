Are you tired of the usual ALV List, ALV Grid, ALV Object .... Try using a web grid. Now you can use this new technology to create dynamic reports, with a graphical interface greatly improved. 
You can try it without installing any additional component sap (SAP FIORI); It is only required to enable the services to be able to publish the pages created, for this you can use transaction SICF.

in this thread we learn how to create a dynamic BSP with the help of a JavaScript library (Angular.js) and a cascading style sheet (Bootstrap).

<pre><code data-trim class="yaml">
icon-36p: "/img/web-app/icon-36p.png"
</code></pre>

<small>If you want to disable this feature, simply set the web-app-mode variable to False</small>

This is how your website will look when added to the homescreen:
