Are you tired of the usual ALV List, ALV Grid, ALV Object... Try using a web grid. Now you can use this new technology to create dynamic reports, with a graphical greatly improved interface. 
You can try it without installing any additional component (SAP FIORI); It's only required to enable the services to be able to publish the pages created, for this you can use transaction SICF.

in this thread we learn how to create a dynamic BSP with the help of a JavaScript library (Angular.js) and a CSS (Bootstrap).

icon-36p: "/img/web-app/icon-36p.png"

This is how your website will look when added to the homescreen:
